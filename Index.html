<!-- IMPORTANT: Below you are associating the link stylesheet with MYSTYLE2.CSS that we have in this folder. This is a code that 
was created in CSS through Adobe Dreamweaver. If you don't have Adobe Dreamweaver, please download it for free from CSUMB. Please google ADOBE CSUMB and download ADOBE 
products (not others - just Adobe Dreamweaver is fine) for free. CSUMB students can login through their CSUMB email address and get that software for
free. The TIGER's background is from that MYSTYLE2.CSS. But for your home purpose (for spring break week), you can just play with INDEX notepad code and ignore MYSTYLE2.CSS -->

	<p> Welcome, Guest!</p>
        <p>My name is Jonathan Rico. I am a junior at California State University-Monterey Bay (<a href="https://www.csumb.edu" target="_blank">CSUMB</a>). My major is business with a concentration in marketing. I am on track to graduate in Spring 2018.</p>
	<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.cityofsalinas.org/" target="_blank">Salinas, California</a> and I have lived there my whole life. I grew up with my father, mother, older brother and older sister. Currently, I live at my parent's house along with my mom, my dad, and my grandmother. We also have one pet chihuahua.</p>
    <p>I spend most of my free time hanging out with my friends. When I have free time to myself, I usually work in Photoshop and in Premier Pro on several projects for a community. During the summer, I run various community events.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include: working in Photoshop, working in Premier Pro, tournamnet organizing, working out, watching sports, and reading. My favorite sports teams include the <a href="http://www.nba.com/lakers/?tmd=1" target="_blank">Los Angeles Lakers</a>,  <a href="https://www.mlb.com/giants" target="_blank">San Francisco Giants</a>, and the <a href="http://www.raiders.com/" target="_blank">Oakland Raiders</a>.</p>
    <p> Some of my favorite books include the <i>Harry Potter</i> series, <i>1984</i>, and <i>Watership Down</i>. Although it's been a while since I've picked up a book, I still enjoy being outside in my backyard as I read a book whenever I have the free time to do it. I usually do this during the summer since the weather is great and because it's when I have no worries of any assignments I need to complete.

          <p> As of the last time this website was updated, I have not worked a paid job. However, I have worked as volunteer at my former high school, Alisal High School. I have also volunteered at the local YMCA as a children's basketball coach.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p> I am currently working on my own social media events. The events are held for 1-3 weeks and have garnered a steady amount of interest and have a total of over 1,000 pariticpants. At this point in time, I am working on a social media strategy for my next event and planning advertisements that are meant to raise event awareness and also communicate what the event is in as few words as possible.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>I intend to apply for an internship for over the summer or a job starting next month. I know it is important to have work experience so I am now focused on dedicating my time towards job or internship opportunities that are related to my carrer choice.</p>
